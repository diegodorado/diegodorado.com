Soon enough several questions emerged:\n What common language could we adopt to describe a piece of music without tying it to a specific work?\n How to translate ATLAS data into a descriptive\npiece of music to drive both music and visuals?\n What will be the framework to manage collaborations in such a work?</p>\n<h2>Look at the Video</h2>\n<p><div>\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 56.49999999999999%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\"\n          >\n            <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/191642319\" class=\"embedVideo-iframe\" allowfullscreen style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n        </div>\n      <style>\n        .embedVideo-iframe {\n          border: 0\n        }\n      </style>\n          </div>\n          </div></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"LHCVMM","date":"January 01, 2016","description":"Large Hadron Collider Visual Music Machine"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/works/lhcvmm/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/works/blue-mountain/","type":"works"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Blue Mountain"}}}}
