Inclusion and sustainability are at the core of this project that advocates recovering the native languages ​​that have been so neglected over the years as well as fosters a relationship with nature that seems to have been lost in time.

The album was composed and produced by Josefina Barreix & Andres Marino, mixed by Pablo Del Fauno Gil & Andrés Marino in *Ideo Music Studio*, and mastered by Pablo Del Fauno Gil in *La Siesta del Fauno Studio-Lab*.

The album was a success and attracted the attention of many people who wanted to take part on it. That is why it has featuring Flor Wosh (choirs in "Dysecdysis"), Ernesto Romeo (synthesizers in "Incorporo"), Violeta García (violoncello in "Incorporo"), Santiago Colombatto (bowls in "Incorporo"), Abelardo Saravia (choirs in "Incorporo"), Melina Moguilevsky (choirs in "Incorporo"), Guillermina Teves (album cover) and Lea Bon (photography).

Even [Indie Rock Magazine](http://www.indierockmag.com/) got interested and wrote an [article about it](http://www.indierockmag.com/article31854.html).

All this excitement led to the idea of ​​taking the EP to the next level, transforming it into an **audiovisual and scenographic performance**.

### Concept

The work is presented in Spanish, Ranquel (native language), and sounds that represent emotion. Words sometimes obfuscate their purpose and their real connection with emotion, as they are tied to the singular perception and experiences each subject has.

>>>>*There are universal  sounds that overcome the barriers of dialects and languages. Sound as a primary language is a first step towards detoxification.*

The work is comprised of four moments of a mythical story: "Euphoria", "Dysecdysis", "Diaphanus" and "Incorporo".

>#### Euphoria
>Dopamine fills the brain with a feeling of confidence and exaggerated well-being. The self-exalted one takes refuge in itself, getting isolation and solitude. Reality does not satisfy his desires and leads him to that feeling of deep disappointment and the need to rebel against the established.

>#### Dysecdysis
>A skin disease of a reptile that occurs when the shedding of the dead outer skin fails. This process of detoxification can only be overcome by the replacement of the old by the new.

>#### Diaphanus
>Transparent or translucent; which allows light to pass through. It means to appear, not in a deceptive way, but what is manifestly real, what is present for the senses and has strength of evidence.

>#### Incorporo
>So that the human being can learn something from the nature, other intelligences must exist before nature itself, without body, volume or consistency. They belongs to the spirit and can not be perceived by the senses.

### Aesthetics

![](./iolive4.jpg)

The voice is a broad instrument that moves from recognizable human places such as tribal shoutings, whispered poems, ritual choirs and gated vocals towards less familiar digital textures such as granular percussion background echo and synthesized pads

Melancholic wurlitzers and increasingly tense cellos harmonize the sound universe while the rhythm is given by synthetic basses, stuttered drums and samples ranging from metal, glass and fire to jungle field recordings.

The visual prefers the absence of tone so that the main voice is highlighted with a specially handcrafted red cape.
An old abandoned temple emerges in the vast ocean, suspended in a three-dimensional void.
Matter evolves from lonely dust to glowing particles, organically alive  and extremely sensitive to sound.
