It employs the software engineering techniques used by the Open Source development model to discover the music that this kind of distributed and large scale collaboration can offer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The goal was to translate the data generated by the ATLAS detector , one of the four major LHC experiments, into stimuli for the musical composition and performance.</p>\n<p>Since we’ve begun, our intention has been to solve problems as they arise based on the needs of each individual project.\nSoon enough several questions emerged:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What common language could we adopt to describe a piece of music without tying it to a specific work?</li>\n<li>How to translate ATLAS data into a descriptive\npiece of music to drive both music and visuals?</li>\n<li>What will be the framework to manage collaborations in such a work?</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3>The Framework</h3>\n<p>We developed framework  in Supercollider responsible for managing collaborations, receiving sound unit OSC messages, and finally reproducing the music.</p>\n<p>Collaborators register functions that can implement sonically sound units matching certain vocabulary terms by calling a method on the framework. Those functions receive a sound unit object as argument allowing collaborators to use its properties on their implementation. Finally, the framework, listening to OSC messages,  selects the most suitable registered function for each received message and pass the sound unit object to the selected function. This selection is done based on the best match of vocabulary terms of function descriptions and sound unit object properties.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/p/pod/dod-idx/opensemble-a-framework-for-collaborative-algorithmic-music.pdf?c=icmc;idno=bbp2372.2016.036;format=pdf\">A paper</a> was presented to the <a href=\"http://www.computermusic.org/\">Internacional Computer Music Association</a> at <strong>ICMC2016</strong> with deeper details about the project.</p>\n<p>The following diagram can help to explain the project.
