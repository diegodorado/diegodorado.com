That is why it has featuring Flor Wosh (choirs in “Dysecdysis”), Ernesto Romeo (synthesizers in “Incorporo”), Violeta García (violoncello in “Incorporo”), Santiago Colombatto (bowls in “Incorporo”), Abelardo Saravia (choirs in “Incorporo”), Melina Moguilevsky (choirs in “Incorporo”), Guillermina Teves (album cover) and Lea Bon (photography).</p>\n<p>Even <a href=\"http://www.indierockmag.com/\">Indie Rock Magazine</a> got interested and wrote an <a href=\"http://www.indierockmag.com/article31854.html\">article about it</a>.</p>\n<p>All this excitement led to the idea of ​​taking the EP to the next level, transforming it into an <strong>audiovisual and scenographic performance</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Concept</h3>\n<p>The work is presented in Spanish, Ranquel (native language), and sounds that represent emotion. Words sometimes obfuscate their purpose and their real connection with emotion, as they are tied to the singular perception and experiences each subject has.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>There are universal  sounds that overcome the barriers of dialects and languages. Sound as a primary language is a first step towards detoxification.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The work is comprised of four moments of a mythical story: “Euphoria”, “Dysecdysis”, “Diaphanus” and “Incorporo”.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Euphoria\nDopamine fills the brain with a feeling of confidence and exaggerated well-being. The self-exalted one takes refuge in itself, getting isolation and solitude. Reality does not satisfy his desires and leads him to that feeling of deep disappointment and the need to rebel against the established.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dysecdysis\nA skin disease of a reptile that occurs when the shedding of the dead outer skin fails. This process of detoxification can only be overcome by the replacement of the old by the new.</p>\n<p>Diaphanus\nTransparent or translucent; which allows light to pass through. It means to appear, not in a deceptive way, but what is manifestly real, what is present for the senses and has strength of evidence.</p>\n<p>Incorporo\nSo that the human being can learn something from the nature, other intelligences must exist before nature itself, without body, volume or consistency. They belongs to the spirit and can not be perceived by the senses.</p>\n<p><div>\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 56.49999999999999%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\"\n          >\n            <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5pKCk0m2zpQ?rel=0\" class=\"embedVideo-iframe\" allowfullscreen style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n        </div>\n      <style>\n        .embedVideo-iframe {\n          border: 0\n        }\n      </style>\n          </div>\n          </div></p>\n<p>chela\n<div>\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 56.49999999999999%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\"\n          >\n            <div class=\"embedVideo-container\">\n            <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_gTlaWTMAgI?rel=0\" class=\"embedVideo-iframe\" allowfullscreen style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n        </div>\n      <style>\n        .embedVideo-iframe {\n          border: 0\n        }\n      </style>\n          </div>\n          </div></p>\n<p>Scenic Design and Setting > Francisca Armando y Joaquín Oneglia</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"I-O","date":"August 01, 2018","description":"Multidisciplinary digital art project in which the installation scenery is exploited and the creation of a space intervened by the repercussions of the interaction between audio and visuals."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/works/i-o/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/works/cv2612/","type":"works"},"frontmatter":{"title":"CV-2612"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/works/human-aided-music/","type":"works"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Human Aided Music"}}}}
