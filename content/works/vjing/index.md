Along with @frenetikvoid we develop custom applications for interactive visuals
that can be controlled by audio, MIDI, OSC and game controllers.
We work side by side with the artists to make the visuals match theirs expectations,
and to prepare some mechanisms to receive live data from their sets we can use in the performance.

We work the visuals mainly in Unity, plus many 3D model softwares, MaxMSP and openframeworks.

repositories to use Unity for VJing.
