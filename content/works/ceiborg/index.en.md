Ceiborg is a creative laboratory linking textile art and costumes with science and technology.

It develops its techno-textiles through various tools and techniques:
  * electronics and programming to create electro-textiles
  * 3D modeling and printing to produce printed textiles
  * cultivation of fungi and bacteria to generate bio-textiles


Ceiborg is the conjunction of the words ceibo (Argentine national flower) and cyborg (cyber organism).

  > **ceibo** + **cyborg** = **ceiborg**
