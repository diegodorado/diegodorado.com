Along with @frenetikvoid we develop custom applications for interactive visuals that can be controlled by audio, MIDI, OSC and gamepads.
We work close with the artists to make the visuals match theirs expectations, and to prepare some mechanisms to receive live data from their sets we can use in the performance.

We work the visuals mainly in Unity, plus many 3D model softwares, MaxMSP and openframeworks.
