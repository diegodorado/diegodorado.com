Instrumento Optico

Intro
====
IO is an audiovisual and scenographic performance about the recovery of our languages and the relationship with nature through a process of spiritual and material detoxification.

Concept
=======
The work is presented in Spanish, Ranquel (native language), and sounds that represent emotion. Words sometimes obfuscate their purpose and their real connection with emotion, as they are tied to the singular perception and experiences each subject has.

There are universal  sounds that overcome the barriers of dialects and languages. Sound as a primary language is a first step towards detoxification.

The work is comprised of four moments of a mythical story: "Euphoria", "Dysecdysis", "Diaphanus" and "Incorporo".

Euphoria
-------------
Dopamine fills the brain with a feeling of confidence and exaggerated well-being. The self-exalted one takes refuge in itself, getting isolation and solitude. Reality does not satisfy his desires and leads him to that feeling of deep disappointment and the need to rebel against the established.

Dysecdysis
---------------
A skin disease of a reptile that occurs when the shedding of the dead outer skin fails. This process of detoxification can only be overcome by the replacement of the old by the new.

Diaphanus
--------------
Transparent or translucent; which allows light to pass through. It means to appear, not in a deceptive way, but what is manifestly real, what is present for the senses and has strength of evidence.

Incorporo
-------------
So that the human being can learn something from the nature, other intelligences must exist before nature itself, without body, volume or consistency. They belongs to the spirit and can not be perceived by the senses.
